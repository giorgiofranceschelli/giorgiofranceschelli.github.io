  <summary>Abstract</summary> 
  <pre>Measuring machine creativity is one of the most fascinating challenges in Artificial Intelligence. This paper explores the possibility of using generative learning techniques for automatic assessment of creativity. The proposed solution does not involve human judgement, it is modular and of general applicability. We introduce a new measure, namely DeepCreativity, based on Margaret Boden’s definition of creativity as composed by value, novelty and surprise. We evaluate our methodology (and related measure) considering a case study, i.e., the generation of 19th century American poetry, showing its effectiveness and expressiveness.</pre>

* Giorgio Franceschelli and Mirco Musolesi. 2022. Copyright in Generative Deep Learning. _Data & Policy_, 4, E17. [doi:10.1017/dap.2022.10](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/data-and-policy/article/copyright-in-generative-deep-learning/C401539FDF79A6AC6CEE8C5256508B5E#) <details> <summary>Abstract</summary> Machine-generated artworks are now part of the contemporary art scene: they are attracting significant investments and they are presented in exhibitions together with those created by human artists. These artworks are mainly based on generative deep learning (GDL) techniques, which have seen a formidable development and remarkable refinement in the very recent years. Given the inherent characteristics of these techniques, a series of novel legal problems arise. In this article, we consider a set of key questions in the area of GDL for the arts, including the following: is it possible to use copyrighted works as training set for generative models? How do we legally store their copies in order to perform the training process? Who (if someone) will own the copyright on the generated data? We try to answer these questions considering the law in force in both the United States and the European Union, and potential future alternatives. We then extend our analysis to code generation, which is an emerging area of GDL. Finally, we also formulate a set of practical guidelines for artists and developers working on deep learning generated art, as well as some policy suggestions for policymakers. </details>

[arXiv:2104.02726 [cs.LG]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02726) (under review by _ACM Computing Surveys_) <details> <summary>Abstract</summary> There is a growing interest in the area of machine learning and creativity. This survey presents an overview of the history and the state of the art of computational creativity theories, key machine learning techniques (including generative deep learning), and corresponding automatic evaluation methods. After presenting a critical discussion of the key contributions in this area, we outline the current research challenges and emerging opportunities in this field. </details>
